## Overview

MetaSSR is a powerful framework for building Server-Side Rendered (SSR) web applications that is built on [Metacall](https://github.com/metacall/core). It was developed as a real-world use-case for [Metacall](https://github.com/metacall/core) and polyglot programming. This guide will walk you through the installation process and provide an overview of the command-line interface (CLI) to help you get started.
